The calcite-colors repository is where we host Esri's official color documentation that can be seen and is leveraged by[Calcite Web](http://github.com/Esri/calcite-web/). Currently, this repository contains a SASS file that you can use in your projects.

## Color reference files
The following links are to download the .ase swatch for use in Adobe products such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. Additionally, there is a PDF download of the visual reference color palette.

- [Adobe .ase](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors/raw/master/resources/colors.ase)
- [Color palette PDF](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors/raw/master/resources/colors.pdf)

## SASS Variables file
A [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) variables file can be found in the root directory `colors.scss`.  This is the main source to consume the color variables.
