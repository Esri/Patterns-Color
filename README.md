# Patterns-Colors
The Patterns Color repo is where we host Esri's official color documentation that can be see on the forth coming Patterns.esri.com site.  Currently the repo contains a mixture of CSS, SASS and Stylus files tha you can use in your projects.

Feel free to download the files for use in your project or add a refrence in your files that points to the CDN files `CDN Link Coming Soon`.  Also the use of a `Submodule` to import these files into your project.

## SASS Variables file
A [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) variables file can be found in the SCSS folder `scss/variables.scss`.  To learn how to use `Variable` files within SASS please read [USING SASS Variables](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-2).  


## Stylus Variables file
A [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) variables file can be found in the Styus folder `stylus/variables.scss`. To learn how to use `Variable` files within Styus please read [USING Styus Variables](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/variables.html).

## Patterns JSON Folder
The Patterns JSON folder contains the source files that are used to build the pages on Patterns.esri.com and should NOT be used within a project as they contain lots of information not needed for standalone projects.  These files are created with using SCSS.
